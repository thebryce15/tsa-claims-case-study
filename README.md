# TSA Claims Case Study – Project README

## Project Overview
This project analyzes U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) claims data from 2002 to 2017. The objective is to uncover trends in claim volume, average payouts, geographic concentrations, and common claim categories, ultimately informing operational recommendations and portfolio-quality data storytelling.

## Tools & Technologies
- SAS (for data cleaning and export)
- Tableau (for dashboard visualization)
- Microsoft Word (for case study reporting)

## Key Business Questions
- How has the total number of TSA claims changed from 2002–2017?
- Has the average payout per claim increased or decreased over time?
- Which U.S. states generate the most claims?
- What are the most common claim types submitted to the TSA?

## Interactive Dashboard
A public Tableau dashboard was created to communicate the results interactively. It includes charts for:

- TSA claims volume trend by year
- Average payout per claim by year
- Top states for claim frequency
- Most common claim types
